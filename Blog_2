## "Why are you taking Software Engineering and what you hope to get out the class."
The honest response would be because it is required, but I also have just been wanting to do more cs stuff. Taking the previous few cs class, which for me have been a python class, discrete mathematics, a java class, and C++ data structure, I was looking for something more. While the past classes had been interesting it was more just this is what you can do, not what you will be doing when you get a job. Why and what I am hoping to get out of this class is what will be happening when I get a job in the cs field.
