## CHAPTER 2 THE APRAGMATIC APPROACH
Like the last chapter of this book, I agree with what's being said. It makes sense. The first part about DRY and about reducing your code makes the code easier to manage and able to be resused by other parts. It makes sense to me, but I know that I get very lazy and I would probaly just copy and past code unless I had to write it maybe more than 3x depending on length. I find the idea of making code "flexable" or able to be used in more than just the way you intended the code to work to be an easier and better solution for dating and mantaing code, mainly so you don't have to spedn 9+ hours rewriting the whole thing just to make sure it's in line with a new update to some program it's grabing. This is goes hand in hand with a lot of this chapter, orthogonal coding is great for this "flexablity" stuff. It's easier to maintaing and collaborate with others and it seems pretty neat. This early part of this chapter is dedicated to the flexablity of ones code. Like trying to make a jigsaw piece less ridgide so it could fit in nomours different spots, which is what reversal seems to be. Estimation also seems like kinda a given (also NASA wants 14 deciamls for pi) but it is very helpful to know. I like this book but this chapter felt more like a wait Let me look this up and follow the instructions vs the first chapter where it was more along the lines of "This is how it is, and it's better to do stuff like this".
