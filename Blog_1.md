##  “What Software Engineering means to me”
  I have always been interested in computers, I'm fairly positive there is a photo of me when I was only just a 1 or so old, slamming down on my dad's keyboard has he played starcraft. Throughout high school I tried to do more coding related thing, took a cs class (the first time it was every offered at my school) so it was very general, but I really enjoyed it. We started off with using Scratch and were given free reign to do what we want for our first few projects. I, for whatever reason want made a mega man game, which was pure garbage but it was fun poking at it until I got it to "work". We did some more fun stuff with python, which was really helpful when going into CS1 here at xavier. Honestly, when I hear someone say Software Engineering I think a few people sitting in an office slamming on the keyboard mashing out code. It doesn't sound like a thrilling time to me, but when I take more time to reflect on not just "Software Engineering" but "Software Design" I bring a kind of warm and fun feeling to me. Mainly because over one winter break my friends and I were got board and tried to make a video game. No one but me did much coding, but it was great just getting together with my friends and designing this game. That bond of having a group of people passionately working of a piece of software is what comes to mind when thinking about Software Engineering. That and being able to fully wrap my head around Github at times.
