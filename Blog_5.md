## CHAPTER 4 PRAGMATIC PARANOIA
  Like I said in my other posts, I find this book to start to show what it's supposed to be, which is a guide book on how to be a good programmer. While the last few chapters were all about general things this chapter is nice because it begins giving full guides and methods on how to inprove what you do when you code rather than "This is what you should do" this chapter is "This is how you do it". I appreciate the nice little slap the book gives you about how everyone can't code well espcial you, I found this a bit funny. Design by Contract is an interseting idea and like everything in this book, it makes sense. While it doesn't seem like something I would think about doing right away having basicaly a contract that says what I'm supposed to do as a developer and what my peirs are supposed to seems like a productive and a reasonable thing to do. It was interesting that termiating code popped up in this chapter but again it makes sense. Thinking about it more as a semi experianced progarmer I'm probably more willing to accept what's in this book that I would be if I had a lot more programing exerience
