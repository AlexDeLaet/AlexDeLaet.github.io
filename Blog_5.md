## CHAPTER 4 PRAGMATIC PARANOIA
  Like I said in my other posts, I find this book to start to show what it's supposed to be, which is a guide book on how to be a good programmer. While the last few chapters were all about general things this chapter is nice because it begins giving full guides and methods on how to inprove what you do when you code rather than "This is what you should do" this chapter is "This is how you do it". I appreciate the nice little slap the book gives you about how everyone can't code well espcial you, I found this a bit funny.
