## CHAPTER 1 APRAGMATIC PHILOSOPHY
This chapter was pretty neat for setting the tone of this book. It thankfully doesn't read like a textbook and seems to be formatted for people to actually read it. The first few spots weren't too interesting but it was nice that they were there, reminding people who may not know to take responsibility for what they have done and what others have done as well as to keep a good mindset when trying to get pasts deadlines and fix code. I enjoyed the little stories and anecdotes sprinkled thought the chapter, it help to keep me engaged. The stone soup and being an agent of change was interesting but kind of a given, and the following part about know when to stop and quality control was nice to make sure I had down, but still felt like stuff I already knew. That's the way I felt with the remaining sections as well. It was all nice to look over but I found myself often saying to myself "Well yeah duh". The knowing your skills and communication were all stuff I had knew to do for a very long time and seems like given information to me. I, like everyone, will definitely have a lapse in what to do at time and not follow some of the thing listed in this chapter but I can definitely realize my error later on. I found this first section be a good intro, and will mainly seeming to be common sense still was able to keep me engaged with many of its sections.
